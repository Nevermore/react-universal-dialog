# React Universal Dialog

Makes it easy to create dialogs with content that you don't have full knowledge of beforehand.

- Dialog is always centered, no matter the width/height, and responds to size changes at any moment
- Content is is always pixel-perfect aligned to prevent blurry subpixel rendering
- Can open multiple dialogs at once

Tested on a wide range of browsers:

- Chrome - latest stable
- Firefox - latest stable
- iOS Safari - latest stable
- IE - 9/10/11
- ~~Edge - latest stable~~ (Not yet, but IE works, so should be safe)

Actual support is even wider, but no testing is done. Feel free to send bug reports.
